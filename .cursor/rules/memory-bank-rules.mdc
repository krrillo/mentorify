# 🧠 Memory Bank Rules

## 📌 Purpose
Ensure that all key project documents inside `/memory-bank` stay up-to-date and consistent with ongoing code and architectural changes.

## 🧩 Behavior
- When any major **backend**, **frontend**, or **AI logic** file is updated, propose a corresponding edit in the relevant memory-bank document.
- When the developer makes significant architectural or design changes, automatically suggest updates to:
  - `01-architecture.md`
  - `02-components.md`
  - `07-decisions.md`

## ✍️ Update Workflow
- Use clear section headers (`##`) for each addition.
- When a commit modifies multiple modules, summarize the relationship changes in **03-development-process.md**.
- For every new API route or AI integration:
  - Add it to **04-api-documentation.md**.
  - Update examples if payload or response formats change.
- When new AI tools, models, or prompts are introduced:
  - Document usage in **06-ai-usage.md** with “Before/After” examples.

## 🧱 Format Consistency
- Always use `###` for subsections and `**bold**` for field names.
- Include code snippets inside triple backticks (```) with explicit language markers (json, ts, py).
- Maintain chronological order in `05-progress-log.md`.

## 🧑‍💻 Human Oversight
- The AI assistant must **never overwrite existing sections** automatically.
- Instead, propose edits as appended suggestions with the tag:
<!-- 🧠 Suggested update by Cursor AI -->
- The developer will manually review and accept these updates.

## ✅ Validation
- Before final commits, verify:
- All referenced files exist.
- Links between architecture diagrams, APIs, and components are consistent.
- No placeholder text remains (“TBD”, “TODO”, etc.).
